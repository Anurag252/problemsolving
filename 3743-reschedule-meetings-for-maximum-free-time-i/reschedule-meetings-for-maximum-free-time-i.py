        the longest free time can be achived if they are all togather
        also to maintain the order, find the smallest empty gaps and reduce it further -> no this may not work
        then find largest empty gaps and increase it 
        y greedy works - say increasing largest by x  does not yield the largest time, then it means inc 2nd largest by x yields ? which cannot be true as if x > y, then x + 3 > y + 3
            maybe we take all free spaces and then start moving empty spaces to larger one k times
            start by reducing largest meeting
