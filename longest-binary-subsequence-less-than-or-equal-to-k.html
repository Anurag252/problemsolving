	<p>class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, s: str, k: int) -&gt; int:
        &#8220;&#8221;&#8220;
        we find the number and attach leading zeros
        the problem is we can have multiple such numbers, so we find the right most 
        number
        so essentially we find a rightmost subsequence that matches 
        k
        did not understand Q correctly, basically take all 0s
        and then take as many ones as possible
        is it possible that a zero can be left out and still get ans ? No
        as a zero before all ones must be taken and a zero after 1 cannot help get 2 1s
