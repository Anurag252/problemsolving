        we can use map somehow to find condition in above statement
        say a number a[i] % k = l
        and in map we need to find v[n-i] - l version.
        The problem arises that we still need to scan twice


        another approach is reduce all by dividing with k so evenry number is < k
        now if a[i] and a[j]  will have remainder as a[i] + a[j]

        basically since k < 1000, take ana rray of size 1000, and at event element store the size ,
        another array to store the original a[i] % k, now loop over all and find out  largest[orig[i] + curr % k] value so that it is max. 


        we need to store the end index of subsequence in original[i] where i is the sum module we are trying to create , 
        then loop over all m in nums
        and for each m , loop over original and find index such that i = (m1 + nums[original[i]])% k
        if yes then original[i] = this index
        and len also inc by 1

        # it stores that at index n-i, the value of the running mod , 
        # we see that single dp is not sufficinet bcoz a,b ....c here c can form multiple mod sums
