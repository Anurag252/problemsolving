        what if we went greedy, for every subsequence keep taking all
        elems , till max and min is satified
        and leave others
        is this union find ?
        find all nodes that at at most k 
        this approach is n2
        greedy does not work in case
        3,5,6,1,2-
        3,5 | 6 | 1,2
        5,6 | 3,1,2
        starting at index i, take longest subsequence, this greedy works
        /////// missed that sorting already works, I assumed soring will
        ////// only work for grps, rest was fine
