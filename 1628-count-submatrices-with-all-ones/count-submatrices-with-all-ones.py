            a rectangle is x + 1, y or y + 1, x
            if 1,1 is present then we move x +1 or y + 1
            if true then we move x + 1, y + 1
            at any point we have 3 possibilities of rectangles
            row | col or row,col
            so at any point 
            T[i,j] = 1 + T[i + 1, j] -> this is row based rectangle
            S[i,j] = 1 + S[i, j+ 1] -> this is col based
            say we have a r row and c col
            then number of rectangles starting at i,j is row * col
            as size 1*1, then 1*2 ..1*n ( of row len 1)
            then size 2*1, 2*2 .... 2*n (of row length 2)
            ignore below ---->

            Q[i,j] = 1 +  max(Q[i+1,j], min(S[i+1,j], S[i,j])) -> this is both row and col based

            what if the reactangle is 2*n
            2*2 we can could as a reactangle 
            we cannot count normally 2*n , 
            what if Q is not needed,
            We just have a 1*2 and 2*1 and next cell is 2*1
