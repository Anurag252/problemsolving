## [Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can **add** x to or **subtract** x from any element in the grid.

A **uni-value grid** is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations to make the grid **uni-value***. If it is not possible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/21/gridtxt.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** We can make every element equal to 4 by doing the following: 
- Add x to 2 once.
- Subtract x from 6 once.
- Subtract x from 8 twice.
A total of 4 operations were used.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/21/gridtxt-1.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[1,5],[2,3]], x = 1
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We can make every element equal to 3.

```

Example 3:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/21/gridtxt-2.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], x = 2
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** It is impossible to make every element equal.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	m == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 105
	1 <= m * n <= 105
	1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 104

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]], x: int) -> int:
        # brute force one can easly apply change on one element and recurse on others
        # grid is not needed, it could be one array
        # intutn - minimum steps would be somewhere between min amd max, maybe no
        # could we bin search for min element ? no as # of operations is no incr
        # in fact its a curve with lowest point as answer
        # is it true that uni val is always one of the elements of array ? yes , may be no
        # if there are two elements with same is that uni value - not necessary 
        # imagine 1,2,3,5,5 - 1 - making uni val as 3 we get 7 but unival as 5 we get 9 ops
        # line sweep ? 
        # how about dp - T[] = T[]
        # of all states possible ans lies in one path to node
        # we do not know dest node or path 
        # bfs 
        # after first hint, substraction is division -> 
        # 2 + 2k1, 4 + 2k2 . . . 6 + 2k3 , 8 + 2k4
        # 2 - 2k1 , ...
        nums_array = []
        result = 0

        # Flatten the grid into nums_array
        for row in grid:
            for num in row:
                nums_array.append(num)

        # Sort nums_array in non-decreasing order to easily find the median
        nums_array.sort()

        length = len(nums_array)
        # Store the median element as the final common value
        final_common_number = nums_array[length // 2]

        # Iterate through each number in nums_array
        for number in nums_array:
            # If the remainder when divided by x is different, return -1
            if number % x != final_common_number % x:
                return -1
            # Add the number of operations required to make the current number equal to final_common_number
            result += abs(final_common_number - number) // x

        return result
