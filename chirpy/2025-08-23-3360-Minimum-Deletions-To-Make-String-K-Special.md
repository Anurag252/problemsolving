## [Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be **k-special** if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return *the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make* word ***k-special***.

 

Example 1:

**Input: **word = "aabcaba", k = 0

**Output: **3

**Explanation:** We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.

Example 2:

**Input: **word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2

**Output: **2

**Explanation:** We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.

Example 3:

**Input: **word = "aaabaaa", k = 2

**Output: **1

**Explanation:** We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= word.length <= 105
	0 <= k <= 105
	word consists only of lowercase English letters.
