## [Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given a string s, return *the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of *s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

	For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "aabca"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "adc"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** s = "bbcbaba"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")

```

 

**Constraints:**

	3 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists of only lowercase English letters.

            if arr[ord(k) - ord('a')] == (-1,-1):
                arr[ord(k) - ord('a')] = (idx, -1)
            else:
                arr[ord(k) - ord('a')] = (arr[ord(k) - ord('a')][0], idx)
        # there may a problem of duplicates - will not  be
        res = 0

            if k0 >= 0 and k1 >= 0 and k1 > k0 + 1:
                st = set()
                for m in s[k0+1:k1]:
                    st.add(m)
                res += (len(st))
        return res
