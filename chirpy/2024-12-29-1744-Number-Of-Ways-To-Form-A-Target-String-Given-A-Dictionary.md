## [Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-form-a-target-string-given-a-dictionary) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

You are given a list of strings of the **same length** words and a string target.

Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:

	target should be formed from left to right.
	To form the ith character (**0-indexed**) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
	Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you **can no longer** use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
	Repeat the process until you form the string target.

**Notice** that you can use **multiple characters** from the **same string** in words provided the conditions above are met.

Return *the number of ways to form target from words*. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** There are 6 ways to form target.
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** There are 4 ways to form target.
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= words.length <= 1000
	1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
	All strings in words have the same length.
	1 <= target.length <= 1000
	words[i] and target contain only lowercase English letters.
