## [Cousins in Binary Tree II](https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree-ii) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the **sum of all its cousins' values**.

Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.

Return *the *root* of the modified tree*.

**Note** that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/example11.png)
```

**Input:** root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
**Output:** [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/diagram33.png)
```

**Input:** root = [3,1,2]
**Output:** [0,0,0]
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
	1 <= Node.val <= 104
