## [Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given the root of a binary tree, return *the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves*.

Recall that:

	The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
	The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
	The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/01/sketch1.png)
```

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
**Output:** [2,7,4]
**Explanation:** We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.
```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** root = [1]
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** root = [0,1,3,null,2]
**Output:** [2]
**Explanation:** The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
	0 <= Node.val <= 1000
	The values of the nodes in the tree are **unique**.
