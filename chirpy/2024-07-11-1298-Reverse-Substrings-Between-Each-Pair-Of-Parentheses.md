## [Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-substrings-between-each-pair-of-parentheses) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a string s that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.

Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.

Your result should **not** contain any brackets.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "(abcd)"
**Output:** "dcba"

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "(u(love)i)"
**Output:** "iloveu"
**Explanation:** The substring "love" is reversed first, then the whole string is reversed.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"
**Output:** "leetcode"
**Explanation:** First, we reverse the substring "oc", then "etco", and finally, the whole string.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= s.length <= 2000
	s only contains lower case English characters and parentheses.
	It is guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.

                found = False
                while not found:
                    ls.append(stack.pop())
                    if ls[-1] == "(":
                        found = True
                del ls[-1]
                
                for v in ls:
                    stack.append(v)

            else:
                stack.append(k)
        return ''.join(stack)
