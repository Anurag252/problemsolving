## [Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

 

Example 1:

**Input:** n = 11

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The input binary string **1011** has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

**Input:** n = 128

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The input binary string **10000000** has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:

**Input:** n = 2147483645

**Output:** 30

**Explanation:**

The input binary string **1111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty set bits.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= n <= 231 - 1

 

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

```python


class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        t = 1
        count = 0
        while(n > 0):
            print(n)
            result = n & 1
            if result == 1:
                count = count + 1
            n=n >> 1
        return count

        


{% endraw %}
```
