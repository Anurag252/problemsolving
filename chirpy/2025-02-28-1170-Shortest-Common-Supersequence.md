## [Shortest Common Supersequence ](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

Given two strings str1 and str2, return *the shortest string that has both *str1* and *str2* as **subsequences***. If there are multiple valid strings, return **any** of them.

A string s is a **subsequence** of string t if deleting some number of characters from t (possibly 0) results in the string s.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
**Output:** "cabac"
**Explanation:** 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** str1 = "aaaaaaaa", str2 = "aaaaaaaa"
**Output:** "aaaaaaaa"

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
	str1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.
