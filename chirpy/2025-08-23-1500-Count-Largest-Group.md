You are given an integer n.

Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits.

Return *the number of groups that have the largest size*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** n = 13
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= n <= 104
