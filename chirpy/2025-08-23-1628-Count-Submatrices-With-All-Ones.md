## [Count Submatrices With All Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-all-ones) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given an m x n binary matrix mat, *return the number of **submatrices** that have all ones*.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/27/ones1-grid.jpg)
```

**Input:** mat = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** 
There are 6 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 3 rectangles of side 2x1.
There is 1 rectangle of side 2x2. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x1.
Total number of rectangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/27/ones2-grid.jpg)
```

**Input:** mat = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0]]
**Output:** 24
**Explanation:** 
There are 8 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 5 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x3. 
There are 4 rectangles of side 2x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 2x2. 
There are 2 rectangles of side 3x1. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x2. 
Total number of rectangles = 8 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 24.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= m, n <= 150
	mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

            a rectangle is x + 1, y or y + 1, x
            if 1,1 is present then we move x +1 or y + 1
            if true then we move x + 1, y + 1
            at any point we have 3 possibilities of rectangles
            row | col or row,col
            so at any point 
            T[i,j] = 1 + T[i + 1, j] -> this is row based rectangle
            S[i,j] = 1 + S[i, j+ 1] -> this is col based
            say we have a r row and c col
            then number of rectangles starting at i,j is row * col
            as size 1*1, then 1*2 ..1*n ( of row len 1)
            then size 2*1, 2*2 .... 2*n (of row length 2)
            ignore below ---->

            Q[i,j] = 1 +  max(Q[i+1,j], min(S[i+1,j], S[i,j])) -> this is both row and col based

            what if the reactangle is 2*n
            2*2 we can could as a reactangle 
            we cannot count normally 2*n , 
            what if Q is not needed,
            We just have a 1*2 and 2*1 and next cell is 2*1
