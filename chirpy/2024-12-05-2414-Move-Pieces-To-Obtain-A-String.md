## [Move Pieces to Obtain a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-pieces-to-obtain-a-string) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given two strings start and target, both of length n. Each string consists **only** of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' where:

	The characters 'L' and 'R' represent pieces, where a piece 'L' can move to the **left** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its left, and a piece 'R' can move to the **right** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its right.
	The character '_' represents a blank space that can be occupied by **any** of the 'L' or 'R' pieces.

Return true *if it is possible to obtain the string* target* by moving the pieces of the string *start* **any** number of times*. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** start = "_L__R__R_", target = "L______RR"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to "**L**___R__R_".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to "L___R___**R**".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to "L______**R**R".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** start = "R_L_", target = "__LR"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain "_**R**L_".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** start = "_R", target = "R_"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The piece in the string start can move only to the right, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.
```

 

**Constraints:**

	n == start.length == target.length
	1 <= n <= 105
	start and target consist of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_'.
