## [Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-combination-with-bitwise-and-greater-than-zero) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

The **bitwise AND** of an array nums is the bitwise AND of all integers in nums.

	For example, for nums = [1, 5, 3], the bitwise AND is equal to 1 & 5 & 3 = 1.
	Also, for nums = [7], the bitwise AND is 7.

You are given an array of positive integers candidates. Evaluate the **bitwise AND** of every **combination** of numbers of candidates. Each number in candidates may only be used **once** in each combination.

Return *the size of the **largest** combination of *candidates* with a bitwise AND **greater** than *0.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** candidates = [16,17,71,62,12,24,14]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The combination [16,17,62,24] has a bitwise AND of 16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0.
The size of the combination is 4.
It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than 4 has a bitwise AND greater than 0.
Note that more than one combination may have the largest size.
For example, the combination [62,12,24,14] has a bitwise AND of 62 & 12 & 24 & 14 = 8 > 0.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** candidates = [8,8]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The largest combination [8,8] has a bitwise AND of 8 & 8 = 8 > 0.
The size of the combination is 2, so we return 2.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= candidates.length <= 105
	1 <= candidates[i] <= 107

```python


class Solution:
    def largestCombination(self, candidates: List[int]) -> int:
        res = [0] * 24
        t = 1
        for i in range(1,25):
            for k in candidates:
                if k & t != 0:
                    res[i-1] += 1
            t = t << 1
        return max(res)
        


        


{% endraw %}
