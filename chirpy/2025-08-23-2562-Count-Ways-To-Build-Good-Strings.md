## [Count Ways To Build Good Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

	Append the character '0' zero times.
	Append the character '1' one times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A **good** string is a string constructed by the above process having a **length** between low and high (**inclusive**).

Return *the number of **different** good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties.* Since the answer can be large, return it **modulo** 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** 
One possible valid good string is "011". 
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= low <= high <= 105
	1 <= zero, one <= low
