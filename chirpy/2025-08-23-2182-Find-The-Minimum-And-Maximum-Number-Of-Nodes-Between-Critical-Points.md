## [Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list head, return *an array of length 2 containing *[minDistance, maxDistance]* where *minDistance* is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and *maxDistance* is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return *[-1, -1].

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a1.png)
```

**Input:** head = [3,1]
**Output:** [-1,-1]
**Explanation:** There are no critical points in [3,1].

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png)
```

**Input:** head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
**Output:** [1,3]
**Explanation:** There are three critical points:
- [5,3,**1**,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,**5**,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,**1**,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

```

Example 3:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/14/a5.png)
```

**Input:** head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
**Output:** [3,3]
**Explanation:** There are two critical points:
- [1,**3**,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,**3**,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [2, 105].
	1 <= Node.val <= 105
