## [Maximum Score From Removing Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

	Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.

		For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".

	Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.

		For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".

Return *the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on* s.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
**Output:** 19
**Explanation:**
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
**Output:** 20

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	1 <= x, y <= 104
	s consists of lowercase English letters.
