## [Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-two-arrays-equal-by-reversing-subarrays) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any **non-empty subarray** of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return true *if you can make *arr* equal to *target* or *false* otherwise*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** target = [7], arr = [7]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** arr is equal to target without any reverses.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** arr does not have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	target.length == arr.length
	1 <= target.length <= 1000
	1 <= target[i] <= 1000
	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

```python


class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        #print(target, arr)
        return sorted(target) == sorted(arr)
        if len(target) == 1 and target[0] == arr[0]:
            return True

        for k in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[k] == target[0]:
                if self.canBeEqual(target[1:], (list(reversed(arr[0:k+1])) + arr[k+1:])[1:] ):
                    return True
        return False
        


{% endraw %}
```
