## [Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given an integer array nums.

In one move, you can choose one element of nums and change it to **any value**.

Return *the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums **after performing at most three moves***.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** nums = [5,3,2,4]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.
```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** nums = [3,100,20]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

```c


int compare(void* a, void* b){
   int k1 =  *((int*)(a));
   int k2 = *((int*)(b));
   return k2-k1;
}

int MIN(int a, int b){
    if (a < b){
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}

int minDifference(int* nums, int numsSize) {
   qsort(nums, numsSize, sizeof(int), compare);

    if (numsSize <= 4){
        return 0;
    }
    int result = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0 ; i + numsSize -4 < numsSize; i ++){
        result = MIN(result, nums[i] - nums[i + numsSize -4]);
    }
    return result;
    
}
//95,82,81,75,20


{% endraw %}
