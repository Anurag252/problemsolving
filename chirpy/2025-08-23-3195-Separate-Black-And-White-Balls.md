## [Separate Black and White Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-black-and-white-balls) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

There are n balls on a table, each ball has a color black or white.

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string s of length n, where 1 and 0 represent black and white balls, respectively.

In each step, you can choose two adjacent balls and swap them.

Return *the **minimum** number of steps to group all the black balls to the right and all the white balls to the left*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "101"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "011".
Initially, 1s are not grouped together, requiring at least 1 step to group them to the right.
```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "100"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "010".
- Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "001".
It can be proven that the minimum number of steps needed is 2.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** s = "0111"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** All the black balls are already grouped to the right.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= n == s.length <= 105
	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
