## [Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of *n* nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-1-graph.jpg)
```

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
**Output:** [2,3]

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)
```

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
**Output:** [1,4]

```

 

**Constraints:**

	n == edges.length
	3 <= n <= 1000
	edges[i].length == 2
	1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
	ai != bi
	There are no repeated edges.
	The given graph is connected.
