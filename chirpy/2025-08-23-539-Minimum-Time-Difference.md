## [Minimum Time Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in **"HH:MM"** format, return *the minimum **minutes** difference between any two time-points in the list*.

 

Example 1:

```
**Input:** timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
**Output:** 1

```

Example 2:

```
**Input:** timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
**Output:** 0

```

 

**Constraints:**

	2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
	timePoints[i] is in the format **"HH:MM"**.

```python


class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        result = []
        for k in timePoints:
            hour = k.split(":")[0]
            minute = k.split(":")[1]
            total = int(hour) * 60 + int(minute)
            result.append(total)
        
        result.sort()
        diff = 1440
        start = 1
        end = len(result)
        while(start < end):
            diff = min(diff, result[start] - result[start-1])
            start += 1
        
        diff = min(diff, result[0] + 1440 - result[-1])
        return diff
