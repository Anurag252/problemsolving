## [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

	For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its **complement** is "010" which is the integer 2.

Given an integer num, return *its complement*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** num = 5
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** num = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= num < 231

 

**Note:** This question is the same as 1009: [https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)

```python


class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        i = 0
        while num > 0:
            t = num & 1
            num = num >> 1
            t = not t
            for k in range(i):
                t = t << 1
            result = result | t
            i += 1
        return result


        


{% endraw %}
