## [Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-reach-last-room-ii) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.

You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the **minimum** time in seconds when you can **start moving** to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an **adjacent** room. Moving between **adjacent** rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, **alternating** between the two.

Return the **minimum** time to reach the room (n - 1, m - 1).

Two rooms are **adjacent** if they share a common wall, either *horizontally* or *vertically*.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** moveTime = [[0,4],[4,4]]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

The minimum time required is 7 seconds.

	At time t == 4, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
	At time t == 5, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.

Example 2:

**Input:** moveTime = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The minimum time required is 6 seconds.

	At time t == 0, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
	At time t == 1, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
	At time t == 3, move from room (1, 1) to room (1, 2) in one second.
	At time t == 4, move from room (1, 2) to room (1, 3) in two seconds.

Example 3:

**Input:** moveTime = [[0,1],[1,2]]

**Output:** 4

 

**Constraints:**

	2 <= n == moveTime.length <= 750
	2 <= m == moveTime[i].length <= 750
	0 <= moveTime[i][j] <= 109
