## [Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given a string s consisting only of characters *a*, *b* and *c*.

Return the number of substrings containing **at least** one occurrence of all these characters *a*, *b* and *c*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "abcabc"
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters *a*, *b* and *c are "*abc*", "*abca*", "*abcab*", "*abcabc*", "*bca*", "*bcab*", "*bcabc*", "*cab*", "*cabc*" *and* "*abc*" *(**again**)*. *

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "aaacb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters *a*, *b* and *c are "*aaacb*", "*aacb*" *and* "*acb*".** *

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** s = "abc"
**Output:** 1

```

 

**Constraints:**

	3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
	s only consists of *a*, *b* or *c *characters.

        # then s[i:j] -> end is the substr
        # we do not need to go till end and just need count if i and j
        # then len(s) - j + 1 for strings starting at i
        # so a sliding window , where we inc when till condition is satisfied and 
        # record the j 
        # then decrement the start by one and keep doing the same
