## [Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given two **0-indexed **integer** **permutations A and B of length n.

A **prefix common array** of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.

Return *the **prefix common array** of *A* and *B.

A sequence of n integers is called a **permutation** if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
**Output:** [0,2,3,4]
**Explanation:** At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
**Output:** [0,1,3]
**Explanation:** At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50
	1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n
	It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.

func findThePrefixCommonArray(A []int, B []int) []int {
    mp := make([]int, len(A))

    res := make([]int, len(A))

    temp := 0

    for i , _ := range A {
        mp[A[i]-1] += 1
        mp[B[i]-1] += 1

        if mp[A[i]-1] == 2 {
            temp += 1
            mp[A[i]-1] = 0
        }

        if mp[B[i]-1] == 2 {
            temp += 1
            mp[B[i]-1] = 0
        }
        res[i] = temp
    }
    return res
}
