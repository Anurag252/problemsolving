## [Special Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-ii) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

An array is considered **special** if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer nums and a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi] your task is to check that subarray nums[fromi..toi] is **special** or not.

Return an array of booleans answer such that answer[i] is true if nums[fromi..toi] is special.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [3,4,1,2,6], queries = [[0,4]]

**Output:** [false]

**Explanation:**

The subarray is [3,4,1,2,6]. 2 and 6 are both even.

Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [4,3,1,6], queries = [[0,2],[2,3]]

**Output:** [false,true]

**Explanation:**

	The subarray is [4,3,1]. 3 and 1 are both odd. So the answer to this query is false.
	The subarray is [1,6]. There is only one pair: (1,6) and it contains numbers with different parity. So the answer to this query is true.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
	1 <= queries.length <= 105
	queries[i].length == 2
	0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= nums.length - 1

        arr2 = [0]
        for idx, k in enumerate(arr):
            if idx + 1 == len(arr):
                break
            arr2.append(k ^ arr[idx + 1])

        temp = 0

                result.append(True)

                result.append(False)
