## [String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in chars:

	If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
	Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string s **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array chars**. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done **modifying the input array,** return *the new length of the array*.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
**Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
**Explanation:** The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** chars = ["a"]
**Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
**Explanation:** The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
**Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
**Explanation:** The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= chars.length <= 2000
	chars[i] is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
