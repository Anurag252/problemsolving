## [Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-i) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

	word is split into numFriends **non-empty** strings, such that no previous round has had the **exact** same split.
	All the split words are put into a box.

Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** word = "dbca", numFriends = 2

**Output:** "dbc"

**Explanation:** 

All possible splits are:

	"d" and "bca".
	"db" and "ca".
	"dbc" and "a".

Example 2:

**Input:** word = "gggg", numFriends = 4

**Output:** "g"

**Explanation:** 

The only possible split is: "g", "g", "g", and "g".

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= word.length <= 5 * 103
	word consists only of lowercase English letters.
	1 <= numFriends <= word.length
