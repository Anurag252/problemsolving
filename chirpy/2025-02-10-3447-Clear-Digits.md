## [Clear Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/clear-digits) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove **all** digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

	Delete the *first* digit and the **closest** **non-digit** character to its *left*.

Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** s = "abc"

**Output:** "abc"

**Explanation:**

There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:

**Input:** s = "cb34"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:**

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
	The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.

```go


func clearDigits(s string) string {
    st := make([]rune,0)
    for _ , k := range s {
        _, err := strconv.Atoi(string(k))
        if err == nil {
            if len(st) > 0 {
                st = st[:len(st)-1]
            }
        } else {
            st = append(st , k)
        }
    }

    m := ""
    for _, k := range st {
        m += string(k)
    }
    return m
}


{% endraw %}
