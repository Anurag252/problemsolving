## [Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-i) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array queries.

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, there is a **unidirectional** road from city i to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1.

queries[i] = [ui, vi] represents the addition of a new **unidirectional** road from city ui to city vi. After each query, you need to find the **length** of the **shortest path** from city 0 to city n - 1.

Return an array answer where for each i in the range [0, queries.length - 1], answer[i] is the *length of the shortest path* from city 0 to city n - 1 after processing the **first **i + 1 queries.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]

**Output:** [3,2,1]

**Explanation: **

After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image10.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.

Example 2:

**Input:** n = 4, queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]

**Output:** [1,1]

**Explanation:**

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image11.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image12.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.

 

**Constraints:**

	3 <= n <= 500
	1 <= queries.length <= 500
	queries[i].length == 2
	0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n
	1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]
	There are no repeated roads among the queries.
