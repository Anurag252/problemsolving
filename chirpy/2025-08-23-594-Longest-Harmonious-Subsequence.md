## [Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].

Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The longest harmonious subsequences are [1,2], [2,3], and [3,4], all of which have a length of 2.

Example 3:

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,1]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No harmonic subsequence exists.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
