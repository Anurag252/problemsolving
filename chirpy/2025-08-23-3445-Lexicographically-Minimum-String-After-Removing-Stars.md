## [Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-minimum-string-after-removing-stars) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.

While there is a '*', do the following operation:

	Delete the leftmost '*' and the **smallest** non-'*' character to its *left*. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.

Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** s = "aaba*"

**Output:** "aab"

**Explanation:**

We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s becomes the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:

**Input:** s = "abc"

**Output:** "abc"

**Explanation:**

There is no '*' in the string.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists only of lowercase English letters and '*'.
	The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all '*' characters.
