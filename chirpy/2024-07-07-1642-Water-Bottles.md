## [Water Bottles](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return *the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink*.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_1_1875.png)
```

**Input:** numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_2_1875.png)
```

**Input:** numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
**Output:** 19
**Explanation:** You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= numBottles <= 100
	2 <= numExchange <= 100

{% raw %}


```c


int replace(int numBottles, int numExchange, int emptyBottle) {
    
    printf("%d %d %d\n", numBottles, numExchange ,emptyBottle);
    if (emptyBottle >= numExchange) {
        numBottles += emptyBottle / numExchange;
        emptyBottle = emptyBottle % numExchange;
    }

    if (numBottles  == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    return numBottles +   replace(numBottles/numExchange  , numExchange, emptyBottle + (numBottles % numExchange) );
}

int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
    return replace(numBottles, numExchange, 0);
}


{% endraw %}
```
