## [Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-lexicographically-smallest-array-by-swapping-elements) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a **0-indexed** array of **positive** integers nums and a **positive** integer limit.

In one operation, you can choose any two indices i and j and swap nums[i] and nums[j] **if** |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit.

Return *the **lexicographically smallest array** that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times*.

An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b. For example, the array [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller than the array [10,2,3] because they differ at index 0 and 2 < 10.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2
**Output:** [1,3,5,8,9]
**Explanation:** Apply the operation 2 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3
**Output:** [1,6,7,18,1,2]
**Explanation:** Apply the operation 3 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3
**Output:** [1,7,28,19,10]
**Explanation:** [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
	1 <= limit <= 109
