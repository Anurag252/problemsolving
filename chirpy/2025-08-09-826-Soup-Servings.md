## [Soup Servings](https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You have two soups, **A** and **B**, each starting with n mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen *at random*, each with probability 0.25 **independent** of all previous turns:

	pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B
	pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B
	pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B
	pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B

**Note:**

	There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.
	The amounts from A and B are poured *simultaneously* during the turn.
	If an operation asks you to pour **more than** you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.

The process stops immediately after any turn in which *one of the soups* is used up.

Return the probability that A is used up *before* B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the** same turn**. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** n = 50
**Output:** 0.62500
**Explanation:** 
If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** n = 100
**Output:** 0.71875
**Explanation:** 
If we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.
If we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.
If we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.71875.
