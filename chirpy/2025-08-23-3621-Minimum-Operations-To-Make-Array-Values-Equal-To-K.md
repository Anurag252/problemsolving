## [Minimum Operations to Make Array Values Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-values-equal-to-k) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

An integer h is called **valid** if all values in the array that are **strictly greater** than h are *identical*.

For example, if nums = [10, 8, 10, 8], a **valid** integer is h = 9 because all nums[i] > 9 are equal to 10, but 5 is not a **valid** integer.

You are allowed to perform the following operation on nums:

	Select an integer h that is *valid* for the **current** values in nums.
	For each index i where nums[i] > h, set nums[i] to h.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make every element in nums **equal** to k. If it is impossible to make all elements equal to k, return -1.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [5,2,5,4,5], k = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The operations can be performed in order using valid integers 4 and then 2.

Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [2,1,2], k = 2

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

It is impossible to make all the values equal to 2.

Example 3:

**Input:** nums = [9,7,5,3], k = 1

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The operations can be performed using valid integers in the order 7, 5, 3, and 1.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 100 
	1 <= nums[i] <= 100
	1 <= k <= 100

```python


class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # keep fetching the largest elements and keep changing them to 
        # h
        # at the end res is num of unique elements > k

        s = set(nums)
        count = 0
        c = 0
        if k > min(nums):
            return -1
        for m in nums:
            if m == k:
                c += 1
        if c == len(nums):
            return 0

        for m in s:
            if m > k:
                count += 1
            
            
       
        return count if count > 0 else -1

        


{% endraw %}
