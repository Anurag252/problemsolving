## [Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-longest-special-substring-that-occurs-thrice-i) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called **special** if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

Return *the length of the **longest special substring** of *s *which occurs **at least thrice***, *or *-1* if no special substring occurs at least thrice*.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "aaaa"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "**aa**aa", "a**aa**a", and "aa**aa**".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "abcdef"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** s = "abcaba"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "**a**bcaba", "abc**a**ba", and "abcab**a**".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	3 <= s.length <= 50
	s consists of only lowercase English letters.
