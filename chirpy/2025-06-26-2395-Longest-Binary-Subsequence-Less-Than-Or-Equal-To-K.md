## [Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

Return *the length of the **longest** subsequence of *s* that makes up a **binary** number less than or equal to* k.

Note:

	The subsequence can contain **leading zeroes**.
	The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
	A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** s = "1001010", k = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** s = "00101001", k = 1
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
	1 <= k <= 109

        we find the number and attach leading zeros
        the problem is we can have multiple such numbers, so we find the right most 
        number
        so essentially we find a rightmost subsequence that matches 
        k
        did not understand Q correctly, basically take all 0s
        and then take as many ones as possible
        is it possible that a zero can be left out and still get ans ? No
        as a zero before all ones must be taken and a zero after 1 cannot help get 2 1s
