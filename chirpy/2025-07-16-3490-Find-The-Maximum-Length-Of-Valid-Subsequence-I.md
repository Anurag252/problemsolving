## [Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-i) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)You are given an integer array nums.

A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called **valid** if it satisfies:

	(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2.

Return the length of the **longest** **valid** subsequence of nums.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [1,2,1,1,2,1,2]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].

Example 3:

**Input:** nums = [1,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 3].

 

**Constraints:**

	2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 107
