## [Three Consecutive Odds](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** arr = [2,6,4,1]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are no three consecutive odds.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= arr.length <= 1000
	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

{% raw %}


```c



bool threeConsecutiveOdds(int* arr, int arrSize) {
    //qsort(arr, arrSize, sizeof(int), compare);
    int a = 0;
    int prev = 0;
   
    for (int i = 0 ; i < arrSize ; i ++) {
        if (arr[i] % 2 != 0 ) {
                a ++;
        } else {
            a = 0;
        }
        if (a == 3) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
