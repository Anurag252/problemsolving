## [Sliding Puzzle](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-puzzle) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

On an 2 x 3 board, there are five tiles labeled from 1 to 5, and an empty square represented by 0. A **move** consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].

Given the puzzle board board, return *the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved*. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide1-grid.jpg)
```

**Input:** board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide2-grid.jpg)
```

**Input:** board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** No number of moves will make the board solved.

```

Example 3:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide3-grid.jpg)
```

**Input:** board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]

```

 

**Constraints:**

	board.length == 2
	board[i].length == 3
	0 <= board[i][j] <= 5
	Each value board[i][j] is **unique**.
