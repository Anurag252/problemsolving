## [Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-sort-a-binary-tree-by-level) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given the root of a binary tree with **unique values**.

In one operation, you can choose any two nodes **at the same level** and swap their values.

Return *the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a **strictly increasing order***.

The **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node*.*

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/18/image-20220918174006-2.png)
```

**Input:** root = [1,4,3,7,6,8,5,null,null,null,null,9,null,10]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
- Swap 4 and 3. The 2nd level becomes [3,4].
- Swap 7 and 5. The 3rd level becomes [5,6,8,7].
- Swap 8 and 7. The 3rd level becomes [5,6,7,8].
We used 3 operations so return 3.
It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/18/image-20220918174026-3.png)
```

**Input:** root = [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
- Swap 3 and 2. The 2nd level becomes [2,3].
- Swap 7 and 4. The 3rd level becomes [4,6,5,7].
- Swap 6 and 5. The 3rd level becomes [4,5,6,7].
We used 3 operations so return 3.
It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.

```

Example 3:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/18/image-20220918174052-4.png)
```

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Each level is already sorted in increasing order so return 0.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
	1 <= Node.val <= 105
	All the values of the tree are **unique**.
