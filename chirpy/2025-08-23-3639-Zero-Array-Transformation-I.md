## [Zero Array Transformation I](https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-i) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].

For each queries[i]:

	Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
	Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.

A **Zero Array** is an array where all elements are equal to 0.

Return true if it is *possible* to transform nums into a **Zero Array **after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

	**For i = 0:**

		Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
		The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.

Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

	**For i = 0:**

		Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
		The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].

	**For i = 1:**

		Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
		The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
	1 <= queries.length <= 105
	queries[i].length == 2
	0 <= li <= ri < nums.length

        arr = [0] * len(nums)

            subs += arr[i]
            if nums[i] != 0:
