## [Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-fibonacci-subsequence) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

A sequence x1, x2, ..., xn is *Fibonacci-like* if:

	n >= 3
	xi + xi+1 == xi+2 for all i + 2 <= n

Given a **strictly increasing** array arr of positive integers forming a sequence, return *the **length** of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of* arr. If one does not exist, return 0.

A **subsequence** is derived from another sequence arr by deleting any number of elements (including none) from arr, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation**:** **The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```

 

**Constraints:**

	3 <= arr.length <= 1000
	1 <= arr[i] < arr[i + 1] <= 109

        so T[n] = means longest subsequence till n
        T[n] = T[i] + 1 if a[i] + a[j] = a[n] 
        an element can be part of two subsequences and hence we need to store both 
        len, two indexes that sums upto this number
        T[n] = T[n-i] + 1 if arr[n-i] + a[n-i] == arr[n], a[i] = n-i
             = 0
        a number can be a result of two different fib sequences , we need to take longer
        idea here is that we do prev[j] + arr[j]
