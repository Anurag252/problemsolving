## [Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together-ii) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange)

A **swap** is defined as taking two **distinct** positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

A **circular** array is defined as an array where we consider the **first** element and the **last** element to be **adjacent**.

Given a **binary** **circular** array nums, return *the minimum number of swaps required to group all *1*'s present in the array together at **any location***.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
[1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** nums = [1,1,0,0,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** All the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 0.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
