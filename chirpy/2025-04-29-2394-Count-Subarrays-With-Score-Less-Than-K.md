## [Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

The **score** of an array is defined as the **product** of its sum and its length.

	For example, the score of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75.

Given a positive integer array nums and an integer k, return *the **number of non-empty subarrays** of* nums *whose score is **strictly less** than* k.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.
```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1], k = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
Every subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.
[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.
Thus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
	1 <= k <= 1015

        s = sum(nums)

        res = 0
        right = 0

        while(left < len(nums)):
            while right < len(nums) and (total + nums[right]) * (right - left + 1) < k:

                right += 1

            # After expansion, [left, right-1] are all valid
            res += right - left

            # Move left forward

                s -= nums[right]
                right -= 1
