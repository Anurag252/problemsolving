## [Maximum Number of K-Divisible Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-k-divisible-components) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the **value** associated with the ith node, and an integer k.

A **valid split** of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by k, where the **value of a connected component** is the sum of the values of its nodes.

Return *the **maximum number of components** in any valid split*.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/07/example12-cropped2svg.jpg)
```

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We remove the edge connecting node 1 with 2. The resulting split is valid because:
- The value of the component containing nodes 1 and 3 is values[1] + values[3] = 12.
- The value of the component containing nodes 0, 2, and 4 is values[0] + values[2] + values[4] = 6.
It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 2 connected components.
```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/07/example21svg-1.jpg)
```

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We remove the edge connecting node 0 with 2, and the edge connecting node 0 with 1. The resulting split is valid because:
- The value of the component containing node 0 is values[0] = 3.
- The value of the component containing nodes 2, 5, and 6 is values[2] + values[5] + values[6] = 9.
- The value of the component containing nodes 1, 3, and 4 is values[1] + values[3] + values[4] = 6.
It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 3 connected components.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= n <= 3 * 104
	edges.length == n - 1
	edges[i].length == 2
	0 <= ai, bi < n
	values.length == n
	0 <= values[i] <= 109
	1 <= k <= 109
	Sum of values is divisible by k.
	The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
