## [Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:

	1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
	2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
	3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
	4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])

Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell **one time only**.

Return *the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path*.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/13/grid1.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You will start at point (0, 0).
The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
The total cost = 3.

```

Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/13/grid2.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You can follow the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

```

Example 3:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/13/grid3.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]
**Output:** 1

```

 

**Constraints:**

	m == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 100
	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
