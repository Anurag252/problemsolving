## [Three Consecutive Odds](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** arr = [2,6,4,1]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are no three consecutive odds.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= arr.length <= 1000
	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

```rust


impl Solution {
    pub fn three_consecutive_odds(arr: Vec<i32>) -> bool {
        let mut count = 0;
        for k in arr {
            if k % 2 != 0 {
                count += 1;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }

            if count == 3 {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
