## [Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-prefix-scores-of-strings) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

You are given an array words of size n consisting of **non-empty** strings.

We define the **score** of a string word as the **number** of strings words[i] such that word is a **prefix** of words[i].

	For example, if words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"], then the score of "ab" is 2, since "ab" is a prefix of both "ab" and "abc".

Return *an array *answer* of size *n* where *answer[i]* is the **sum** of scores of every **non-empty** prefix of *words[i].

**Note** that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** words = ["abc","ab","bc","b"]
**Output:** [5,4,3,2]
**Explanation:** The answer for each string is the following:
- "abc" has 3 prefixes: "a", "ab", and "abc".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", 2 strings with the prefix "ab", and 1 string with the prefix "abc".
The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
- "ab" has 2 prefixes: "a" and "ab".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", and 2 strings with the prefix "ab".
The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
- "bc" has 2 prefixes: "b" and "bc".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "b", and 1 string with the prefix "bc".
The total is answer[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.
- "b" has 1 prefix: "b".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "b".
The total is answer[3] = 2.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** words = ["abcd"]
**Output:** [4]
**Explanation:**
"abcd" has 4 prefixes: "a", "ab", "abc", and "abcd".
Each prefix has a score of one, so the total is answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	1 <= words.length <= 1000
	1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
